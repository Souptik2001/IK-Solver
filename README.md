# Inverse Kinematics Solver with collision detection

I am using FABRIK algorithm for creating this Inverse Kinematic solver package. I am also implementing a collision avoidance algorithm with the basic FABRIK algorithm.
*For the FABRIK algorithm I am referring to this [research paper](http://andreasaristidou.com/publications/papers/FABRIK.pdf)*

**Remaining Tasks -**

* Angle restrictions (working)
* Pole vector
* Collision Detection
